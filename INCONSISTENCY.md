# Inconsistency Analysis

- **Default pricing curve diverges across entry points** — The factory ships an exponential-to-static default curve (contracts/TemplFactory.sol:158-168), but the deploy CLI labels a static curve as the default when no env overrides are set (scripts/deploy-templ.cjs:65-73), and the test fixture also defaults to a static curve (test/utils/deploy.js:5-62). Deploys driven by the script/tests therefore exercise a different curve than the factory’s documented default.
- **Proposal/referral fee defaults differ between prod and tests** — Factory defaults apply 2,500 bps for both proposal fees and referral share (contracts/TemplFactory.sol:28-30,295-299), while the fixture uses zero for each (test/utils/deploy.js:56-57). Most tests skip the fee paths that are enabled by default on real deployments.
- **Council mode default flips between environments** — Factory deployments and the deploy CLI start templs in council mode when unset (contracts/TemplFactory.sol:298; scripts/deploy-templ.cjs:304-314), but the test fixture defaults to member-wide voting (councilMode = false) (test/utils/deploy.js:60). Test coverage therefore exercises non-default governance rules by default.
- **Post-quorum delay bounds enforced unevenly** — The deploy CLI rejects non-positive POST_QUORUM_VOTING_PERIOD_SECONDS (scripts/deploy-templ.cjs:367-368), but governance can later set the post-quorum period to zero with no validation (contracts/TemplGovernance.sol:173-190; contracts/TemplBase.sol:1371-1376). Runtime state can reach a 0-second post-quorum delay even though genesis tooling forbids it.
- **Optimizer run counts vary across tooling** — Hardhat builds use optimizer runs 500 (1 when running coverage) (hardhat.config.cjs:34-47), while Echidna property tests compile with runs 200 (echidna.yaml:16-18). Different bytecode across test profiles can mask gas-sensitive or optimizer-dependent behavior.
